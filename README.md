# Neon-Void
An Asteroid shooter game (completely vibe coded)

Controls: Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move (with physics-based inertia) and the Mouse to aim and shoot.

Visuals: A vector-neon aesthetic with particle explosions, screen shake on impact, and procedurally generated asteroid shapes.

Progression: The game gets harder as your score increases (more asteroids, faster speeds).

Responsive: It adapts to window resizing.
